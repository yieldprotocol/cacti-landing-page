          This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to

          that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise

          Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service,
          any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions

          arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
          Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in
          small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration
          Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
          of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the
          law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
          entering into these Terms of Service, you and Yield are each waiving
          the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a className action.
          Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or
          jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

          sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or us may
          commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount

          Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance
          with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and
          procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules
          (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
          Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,
          http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for
          consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,
          <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">
            https://www.adr.org/consumer
          </a>
          . If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and
          any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
          Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines
          that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms
          would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator
          must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court
          would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues
          relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
          Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually
          simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial
          proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on
          an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under
          these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator
          are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for
          very limited reasons.

          Unless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take
          place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
          consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
          circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
          determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or
          less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
          conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
          arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing
          as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the
          right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of
          the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will
          issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
          findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

          Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
          (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA
          Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the
          value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, we
          will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more
          than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that
          you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration
          Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you
          should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, we
          will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to
          the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
          compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the
          Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
          arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’
          fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
